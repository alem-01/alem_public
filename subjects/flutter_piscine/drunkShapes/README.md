# Introduction:

Develop an app that simulates gravity. Each time you tap on the screen, red Circle of radius 30px must appear and it must be affected by gravity. 

By tapping on the screen, new circle must appear. The circle must appear only if there is neccessary room to do so, i.e. does not collide with other objects when it is created.

Your shapes must move towards the Earth. Handle the collision of the circles so that they do not fall one in another, i.e. they must collide. All the objects must stay inside the borders of your phone, or any other device.

## Objective

- Working with accelerometer
- Working with tapping and dragging
- "Physics" behind artifical gravity

> Bonus: Add an ability to drag individual circle around the screen. When the circle is let go, it should behave as usual circle. Think of the ways to handle collisions when the circle is dragged on to another circle.
