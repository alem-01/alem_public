# Introduction:

Develop an app with artificial gravity. When you tap on the screen, red Circle of radius 100px must appear and it must be affected by gravity. If your phone is at vertical position, it falls down, if it is in the horizontal position it should move sideways, meaning all the time your shapes must move towards earth. Handle the collision of the circles so that they do not fall one in another, i.e. they must collide. All the objects must not leave the borders of your phone, or any other device.

## Objective

- Working with accelerometer
- Working with tapping and dragging
- "Physics" behind artifical gravity

> Bonus: Add an ability to drag individual circle around the screen. When the circle is let go, it should behave as usual circle. Think of ways to handle collisions when the circle is dragged on to another circle.
