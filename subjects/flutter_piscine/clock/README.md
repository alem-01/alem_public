### Introduction:

Develop an app with the functional of alarm, stopwatch, timer, world clock.

## Objective

- Working with system calls to make alarm, timer
- Apply iOS and Android specific calls for alarm, timer
- Working with Dart's date objects, and their functionality
- Working with memory to memorize alarms, chosen region.
- Using API for world clock.

## Part 1

Make an alarm page. One should be able to add, delete, change alarms. Make sure alarms can be set periodically, i.e. every day.

> Bonus: make it possible to choose alarm sound.

## Part 2:

Make a world clock page. The page shoud display time for all the chosen regions, and remember which regions have been chosen, until they are deleted. Make sure to let users add and delete regions.

> Note: It will be easier to implement via API :)

## Part 3:

Implement Stopwatch's functional. You should be able to start, pause, reset, and stop the stopwatch. Display the time in the format of mm:ss:ms (minutes:seconds:milliseconds).

</center>

## Part 4:

Implement Timer's functional. You should be able to choose hours, minutes, second to start the timer, pause, cancel the timer. Display the time in the format of hh:mm:ss (hours:minutes:seconds).

</center>

> Bonus: add an ability to change timer sound.
