### Introduction:

Develop an app for taking secure notes. A note is considered to be secure if the content of the note cannot be accessed without password verification. You can ensure such security by encripting content of the notes. Make sure to let user access, add, delete, and change, and export notes.

## Objective

- Working with data management, i.e. sqlite
- Encryption
- Biometrics or password usage.

## Part 1:

Make a page for password and sequrity setting, so that each time someone wants to access the app, one should write a password, or do a biometrical authentication.

## Part 2:

Make a central page where notes are displayed. This page must come after password/biometry authentication. At this point one must have an ability to read, add, delete, change all the notes. 
At this point, when you make some changes, you must save notes encrypted so that other apps won't have access to content. Add ability to export individual notes to txt format.

## Part 3:

Implement Authentication that required either a password or a biometrical verification.
