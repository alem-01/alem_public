### Introduction:

Develop an app for taking secure notes. A note is considered to be secure if the content of the note cannot be accessed without password verification. Make sure to let user access, add, delete, and change, and export notes.

## Objective

- Working with data management, i.e. sqlite
- Encryption
- Biometrics or password usage.

## Part 1:

Make a page for password and sequrity setting, so that each time someone wants to access the app, one should write a password, or do a biometrical authentication.

</center>

## Part 2:

Make a central page where notes are displayed. This page must come after password/biometry authentication. At this point one must have an ability to read, add, delete, change all the notes. Add ability to export individual notes to txt format.
