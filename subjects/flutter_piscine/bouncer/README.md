### Introduction

Develop an app that simulates gravity. The app should be a smaller version of the 90s game of bouncing ball, where ball would be moving around, and playerâ€™s objective is to prevent it from touching the bottom of the screen.

The ball should move in a linear manner, bounce off the walls and you tile.
Each time ball hits a tile, tiles should dissappear, except for player's tile.
You should be able to move your tile via tilting your phone.

### Objective

- Working with accelerometer
- "Physics" behind artifical gravity
