# Bouncer

### Introduction

Some apps require using phone's hardware. In this app you are presented such an opportunity.   

Develop an app that applies accelerometer. The app should be a smaller version of the 90s game of bouncing ball, where ball would be moving around, and playerâ€™s objective is to prevent it from touching the bottom part of the screen.


### Rules of the game

- Ball moves in a linear manner
- Ball changes its direction when it hits wall or tiles
- All tiles except player's tile disappear when hit with a ball
- Game ends when ball touches bottom part of the phone
- Player's tile moves according to phone's tiltiness

### Objective

- Working with accelerometer
- "Physics" behind artifical gravity
