## intro

Let's start with standard programming language tradition, write your first `"Hello, world!"` in Dart.

Dart's files extension is `.dart`, create `ex_00.dart` with the following contents and run it!

```dart
void main() {
	print("Hello, World!");
}
```

To run the program, execute a command:

```bash
dart ex_00.dart
```
