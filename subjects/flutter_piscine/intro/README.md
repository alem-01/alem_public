## intro

Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.

Dart (within Flutter) is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

Let's start with standard programming language tradition, write your first `"Hello, world!"` in Dart.

Dart's files extension is `.dart`, create `intro.dart` with the following content and run it!

```dart
void main() {
	print("Hello, World!");
}
```

To run the program, execute a command:

```bash
dart intro.dart
```
